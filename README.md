# Technical Project Management Web Application

This project is a web-based application for Technical Project Management. It dynamically renders project details and tasks from a JSON data structure, providing an interactive interface for project management activities.

## Features

- Dynamic rendering of project title and description
- Display of tasks and associated assets
- Interactive elements for thread building and content creation
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for dynamic content rendering
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the application

## Setup and Running

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Customization

- The project data is stored in the `jsonData` variable in `script.js`. Modify this data to change the project details, tasks, and assets.
- Adjust styles in `style.css` to match your desired design.

## Development

To further develop this application:

1. Modify `script.js` to add more functionality, such as displaying multiple tasks or adding interactivity to buttons.
2. Enhance `style.css` to refine the visual design and improve responsiveness.
3. Update `index.html` if you need to add new structural elements.

## Browser Compatibility

This application is designed to work on modern web browsers. Ensure you're using an up-to-date version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for the best experience.
